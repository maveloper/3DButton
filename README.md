_About this button_

Style

- *Collors*

The font and background colors can be changed. However, under some important requirements to maintain the visual quality of the button.

1.The font colors should remain the same by default.

2.The choice of background color in "a" && "a :: after" should remain the same.

3.The Background in * a :: before * should be the same color as the others, but with a slightly darker tone, for the effect of 3D transition.



- *Effect*

The entire effect pattern was designed so that the button acts fluidly, I suggest that no changes are made. However, if you want to change to your project, I recommend that you take care not to lose the quality and fluidity of the effect.
